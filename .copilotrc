communication_protocols:
  - Here is the regenerated prompt structure for Software Engineering and Offensive Cyber Operations, adapted from:
    -	AAP-06 (NATO Terms)
    -	ACP 125(G) (Radio Discipline)
    -	JP 3-09.3 (Targeting Confirmation)
    -	JSP 398 (UK Fires Doctrine)
    -	STANAG 3797 (Digital Command Coordination)

This format ensures:
  -	Clarity: explicit objective and scope
  -	Brevity: no redundant language
  -	Discipline: structured fields, no deviation
  -	Confirmation: mandatory readback before execution
